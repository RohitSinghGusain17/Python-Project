**Student Management System using Python and MySQL**  
Description: Student Management System is basically a program that helps in keeping the records of the students and their examination details.
In this project, I have used the basic concept of Python and MySQL like- functions, loop, MySQLCursor of mysql-connector-python, and different sql commands.
I have used the mysql-connector library. MySQL Connector is the official Oracle-supported driver to connect MySQL through Python.  

It includes 8 modules:  
1- Add Student Details  
2- Display Student Details  
3- Update Student Details  
4- Delete Student Details  
5- Add Student Examination Details  
6- Display Student Examination Details  
7- Update Student Examination Details  
8- Delete Student Examination Details  

Note: If your system already contains Python and MySQL, install the mysql connector module to connect MySQL through Python.
      mysql-connector method can be installed with the use of following command line:  
      **pip install mysql-connector-python**
